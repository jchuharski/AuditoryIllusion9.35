				<h2>How does priming affect the phase locking limit?</h2>
				<span class="byline">Chuharski, Dow, Hess</span> </div>

				<p>In our illusion, we wanted to explore the influence that priming would have on the percieved
					pitch of notes as a melody was upshifted beyond 4kHz, the limit that the ear can phaselock
					to soundwaves. We were inspired by the NBC chime illusion, where a familiar melody 
					is initially unrecognizable when it's pitches are beyond 4kHz, but as the tune is brought
					into phaselock range and then above it again, the tune is recognizable at higher frequencies
					than before. Now that the tune is known to be a specific melody, it can be percieved at
					beyond the limit for accurate pitch detection. We believe this to be an example of Bayesian
					inference; now that the listener has a new prior on the type of sound they are hearing, that
					being the NBC chime, as long as the rest of the information they can hear is consistent, timing
					and number of notes, they percieve the sound despite having incomplete pitch information.
					The scientific question we wish to answer is whether priming on a recognizable melody aids, 
					inhibits, or does not affect the ability to discriminate between pitches changes within the melody
					 when shifted above the phaselocking limit. As our illusion relies on priming, we will leave a complete
					 explanation of the illusion until after you have tried it.
				</p>
				<p>For this illusion we have created two samples, one that has the melody with normalized note intervals
					and the other with the correct rhythm of the melody. The same sound will be played at a high frequency at first,
					and then decreasing until within phaselocking range, and then increase to the same high frequency again.
					Can you tell what the melody is on the way down? 
					Can you hear any changes on the way up? Listen through each sample twice and see if you notice
					any differences between each playthrough.

				<h3>Illusion Explanation</h3>
				<p>
					In brief, our illusion primes the user with the Imperial March theme that is upshifted an octave at a time, 
					and once the phaselocking limit is passed, changes pitch elements of the sound to see if the changes
					are detectable to the user. Each illusion begins with noise at a high frequency and shifts it down to where the melody
					is recognizable, and then shifts it back up; at the high frequencies of both the start and the finish, the melody has notes
					that are changed. These note changes are clearly perceptible at lower octaves, and we've attached comparisons of the true 
					and altered melodies at the bottom of the page so one can listen to the difference. We've personally found that after
					recognizing the melody at the lower levels, people are able to detect changes to the melody at higher octaves than before.
					By priming the user with a certain melody within the phaselocking limit, the listener now expects to hear the sound they 
					have developed a prior for. With this illusion, we found that we were able to detect the pitch anomalies at much higher 
					frequencies than phaselocking would suggest we'd be able to detect, suggesting that we become more sensitive to pitches
					we expect to hear.

				<p>The spectrograms are ordered with no rhythm first, then with rhythm, and then the extra hard mode sample.</p>

				<h3>Correct Melody Compared to the Changed Melody in Each Illusion</h3>
				<p>Each sound plays the correct melody and then the altered melody for each sample. The first is for the normalized
