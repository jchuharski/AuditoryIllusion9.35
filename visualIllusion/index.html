				<h2>Does an inverted shadow still provide motion cues?</h2>
				<span class="byline">Jake Chuharski, Nick Dow, Preston Hess</span> </div>

				<p>
					In class, we saw that dark shadows provide strong depth cues. The influence of shadows on depth was shown in a image with stacked, occluded
					shapes with drop shadows that gave strong depth cues compared to the same image without shadows. Another version of the image had 
					the colors inverted, which made the shadows white and gave them the apparence of white spray paint or light illumination from beneath.
					The objects seemed to have marginally more depth than the shadowless image, but nothing like the original drop shadow. 
					We also saw an illusion where a sqaure was still, but had a shadow that changed in size against a textured backdrop. This made
					the square appear to pop out in depth, and caused the square to appear to move towards the viewer as the shadow grew. We saw a similar effect with a ball that moved
					on a consistent path, but had a shadow that alternated between two different trajectories. This made the ball appear to move on different paths
					when the shadow's direction changed, either rolling across the ground or floating above it.
				</p>
				<p>
					With our Illusion, we aim to explore the intersection of these effects. We will have a ball that moves in a consistent path,
					but rather than providing depth cues with a shadow, we will provide an inverted shadow. This type of shadow provided marginal to no depth
					cues for the stationary objects, but may still provide depth cues for moving objects that can be percieved in their motion. We hypothesize that the ball will appear to
					take a different path depending on the inverted shadow provided with it. We also have an illusion with a static square, but a moving shadow.
					We hypothesize that the sqaure will not appear to move in depth as much as it does with the dark shadow.
				</p>
				</p>
				<h3>Static Square Illusion</h3>
				<p>The first illusion is a static square with a moving inverted drop shadow. The left video is that of the inverted 
					shadow and the right is that of the regular drop shadow. We provided the original for a comparison of effects.

				</video>
				<h3>Moving Ball Illusion</h3>
				<p>The second illusion is the moving ball illusion, where a ball's can be interpreted as floating or rolling across
					the checkerboard grid and the shadow provides a depth cue for resolving that ambiguity. The inverted shadow 
					version is on the left, and the regular drop shadow is on the right.

				<h3>Addenum: Motion implying shadow</h3>
				<p>Early in our illusion development, we made this demo. While many motion and depths
					are present on the ball and thus the white shadow is not informing perception of the ball,
					the present of the white shadow and it's behavior as a shadow with respect the ball 
					gives the perception of being a light source attached to the ball. We added this to the 
					illusion page to show the "reverse" direction of motion's impact on the perception
					of inverted shadows.
